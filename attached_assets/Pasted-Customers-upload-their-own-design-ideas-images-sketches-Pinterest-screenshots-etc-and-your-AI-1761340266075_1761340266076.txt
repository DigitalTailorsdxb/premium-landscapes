Customers upload their own design ideas (images, sketches, Pinterest screenshots, etc.), and your AI system automatically translates those visuals into structured prompt data — then uses that enriched information to create a personalised garden design for them.

🌿 Feature: “AI Vision Translator for Design Ideas”
🎯 GOAL

When a client uploads their design inspiration images:

The system analyses them using GPT-4 Vision,

Extracts style, layout, and material cues,

Combines that data with the client’s questionnaire (area, budget, style preferences),

Generates a customised DALL·E prompt,

And finally, produces AI-rendered design images that align closely with the client’s references.

🧠 SYSTEM FLOW
User uploads inspiration images + form → n8n Webhook /design
→ GPT-4 Vision Node → “Prompt Builder” Function
→ DALL·E Image Generation → Upload to Cloudflare Images
→ Email + Instant Display on Replit

⚙️ HOW IT WORKS (Node-by-Node Logic)
🧩 1️⃣ Webhook Node — /design

Accepts:

Customer details (email, postcode)

Project info (area, budget, style)

Uploaded inspiration images (array of URLs or base64)

Optional notes or Pinterest link

Example JSON:

{
  "customer": { "name": "Laura", "email": "laura@example.com" },
  "project": {
    "style": "Modern",
    "area": 85,
    "notes": "Love clean lines, privacy, and warm lighting"
  },
  "inspirations": [
    "https://uploads.premiumlandscapes.co.uk/laura_idea1.jpg",
    "https://uploads.premiumlandscapes.co.uk/laura_idea2.jpg"
  ]
}

🧩 2️⃣ GPT-4 Vision Node — “Analyse Inspiration Images”

Purpose: Extracts style, mood, layout, materials, and design intent.

Prompt Example:

“You are an expert landscape designer.
Analyse these uploaded images and describe:
• Primary materials (stone, wood, grass, plants)
• Garden style (modern, tropical, rustic, minimal)
• Lighting, seating, and colour palette
• Distinct features (fire pit, pergola, decking, raised beds, etc.)

Return structured JSON with fields: style, key_materials, features, mood, layout.”

Example output:

{
  "style": "Modern Minimalist",
  "key_materials": ["porcelain paving", "composite decking", "white stone"],
  "features": ["fire pit", "pergola", "LED uplighting"],
  "mood": "calm, warm lighting, open space",
  "layout": "split-level with defined seating zone and lawn"
}

🧩 3️⃣ Function Node — “Merge Client Data + AI Insights”

Combines questionnaire data and AI analysis:

const project = $json.project;
const analysis = $json.analysis;

return {
  json: {
    prompt: `Create a realistic ${analysis.style} garden design for ${project.area} m².
Incorporate ${analysis.key_materials.join(", ")} materials with features such as ${analysis.features.join(", ")}.
Mood: ${analysis.mood}. Layout: ${analysis.layout}.
Also consider client notes: "${project.notes}".`
  }
};

🧩 4️⃣ DALL·E 3 Node — “Generate Custom Design”

Model: dall-e-3

Input: prompt from previous node

Output: 2–3 high-resolution garden renders

Result: AI designs that visually match the client’s inspiration images.

🧩 5️⃣ Cloudflare Images Upload + Email + Respond to Webhook

Same as your previous AI Design workflow — you store, email, and display designs instantly.

🧰 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
Requirement	Purpose
GPT-4 Vision Access (OpenAI)	Needed for analysing uploaded images
DALL·E 3 Access	Generates new designs from prompt
Cloudflare Images or S3	Stores client uploads + AI outputs
Webhook Storage	Replit form uploads via pre-signed link or Cloudflare upload widget
n8n Nodes	Webhook → GPT Vision → Function → DALL·E → Upload → Email → Response
💡 FRONTEND EXPERIENCE (Replit Site)

On the AI Design Page, add an “Upload Inspiration Images” section:

<label>Upload your design ideas or inspiration photos</label>
<input type="file" multiple accept="image/*" id="inspirationUpload" />


The JavaScript collects all uploaded images → converts to URLs/base64 → adds to the payload sent to the /design webhook.

After the workflow runs:

The user immediately sees AI-generated designs tailored to their uploaded ideas.

They also receive an email with all visuals and “AI Analysis Summary.”

🧱 WHY THIS IS POWERFUL
Benefit	Description
Personalisation	Every design is directly influenced by the client’s real tastes
Automation	AI extracts design cues automatically — no manual interpretation
Sales Tool	The email follow-up includes a “design summary” that your sales team can quote from
Scalable	Works identically whether you receive 10 requests or 10,000
Professional Output	Feels like a bespoke design service backed by human designers
🧠 FUTURE ADD-ON

Later, you can use this same logic to:

Let users link Pinterest boards or Instagram images

Use Whisper + Voice Notes → “Explain your dream garden” → transcribed into prompt

Add a “Compare your inspiration vs AI result” slider directly on the page

✅ Summary — “Best Implementation”
Stage	Tool	Output
