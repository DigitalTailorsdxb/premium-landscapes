🚀 Vision
Create a futuristic, conversational, and visual quoting experience that:
* feels effortless for the user,
* gathers structured, high-quality data for accurate pricing, and
* visually reinforces that Premium Landscapes is tech-driven and premium.

🧠 Key Design Principles
1. Chunked Questions (Progressive Disclosure) → Instead of one big form, show one question at a time (multi-step flow). Each step auto-advances — making it feel like a conversation, not admin.
2. Smart Defaults + Suggestions → Predictive tags like “Typical Patio 30 sqm” or “Popular Add-Ons: Lighting, Fence Panels”. Users can click instead of typing.
3. Visual Input Aids → Replace some text boxes with icon or image-based selectors (e.g., “Choose your style”: [Modern] [Low-Maintenance] [Tropical]).
4. AI Chat Feel Without Overload → Smooth transitions between steps, using light animations or a “bot-like” interface (“Got it! Let’s add your postcode next.”).
5. Auto-Generated Summary → As users fill details, a right-hand summary panel updates dynamically: ✅ Patio: Porcelain 40 sqm ✅ Turf: Artificial 25 sqm ✅ Lighting: 10 uplights Total area: 65 sqm 
6. Instant Feedback → “We’re analysing local material and labour prices in your area…” (Shows intelligence + reassurance.)
7. Optional Uploads Made Easy → “Drop a photo or video — AI will help identify dimensions and features automatically.”
8. Final Step: Personalised Estimate Display
    * Shows:
        * Price Range (£X–£Y)
        * Breakdown (Patio, Turf, Fence, Labour, etc.)
        * Confidence Score (e.g., “Based on 92 similar projects in your area”)
        * CTA: “Email Me This Quote” + “Get AI Design Preview”

🧠 NEW EXPERIENCE FLOW (Client Perspective)
1️⃣ Step 1 – Smart Entry (Frontend Form)
* Ask for postcode, project description, and optional photo/video upload.
* Auto-detect region → adjust pricing in n8n.
* Optional slider for area size with examples (“Typical patio: 40 sqm”).
➡️ n8n receives webhook input and triggers workflow.

2️⃣ Step 2 – Input Enrichment (AI & Data Parsing in n8n)
* n8n calls OpenAI node: “Extract and structure project details from: ‘Porcelain patio 55sqm, turf 25sqm, fence 25 m.’ Return as JSON with categories, sizes, and materials.” 
* GPT node outputs:    {
*   "patio": {"material": "Porcelain", "area": 55},
*   "turf": {"type": "Artificial", "area": 25},
*   "fencing": {"length_m": 25}
* }
*   
* n8n uses these structured values for pricing lookup.

3️⃣ Step 3 – Price Calculation
* n8n reads Google Sheet or Airtable:
    * Columns: Feature | Material | BaseCost/m² | Labour/m² | RegionModifier
* It multiplies feature areas/lengths by rates and applies postcode-based modifier.
* Produces:
    * Low/High price range
    * Material cost vs labour split
    * Optional markup %

4️⃣ Step 4 – Quote Generation
* Combine user info + calculated prices into branded HTML template (within n8n).
* Convert to PDF using PDF Generator or HTML to PDF node.
* Output:
    * Summary (Total, Breakdown)
    * AI note: “Estimate based on 120 similar projects in your region”
    * CTA links: “Book Site Visit” / “Request AI Design”

5️⃣ Step 5 – Delivery & CRM Logging
* Email Node → sends PDF + personalised message
* 360dialog Node → optional WhatsApp message (“Here’s your instant estimate, tap to view your AI design.”)
* Airtable/Zoho Node → logs lead data, project type, budget, and confidence score

6️⃣ Step 6 – Optional AI Design Trigger
If user ticks “Generate AI Design”:
* n8n sends image + text prompt to GPT-4 Vision / DALL·E
* Returns multiple style variants (“Modern,” “Tropical,” “Low-maintenance”)
* Saves images to Google Drive / Replit folder
* Sends link in follow-up email or WhatsApp

💎 USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS
Problem	Solution
Too many fields	Use dynamic form with progressive steps (or conversational layout)
Users unsure how to describe projects	Add pre-filled example chips (“Sandstone patio 40 sqm”)
Bland interface	Use animated progress bar + AI loader (“Calculating your quote…”)
Low completion rate	Always show % progress + “Only 2 more quick questions”
Poor engagement post-submission	Immediate WhatsApp/email follow-up with “Here’s your estimate + AI preview option.”
🎨 Suggested Replit Frontend Structure
* Minimalist card layout with:
    * Floating labels
    * Soft shadow, gradient background
    * Left-aligned progress bar
    * Subtle animations per step
* Use fetch() POST → n8n webhook endpoint
* Return JSON response → dynamically render the quote box

🔮 Future Add-ons
* AI Voice Input: Use Whisper API or ElevenLabs for verbal description
* Real-time Pricing Chat: “How much extra for lighting?” → n8n runs recalculation instantly
* Client Portal: Each quote auto-creates a client page with updates, redesigns, and add-ons.
