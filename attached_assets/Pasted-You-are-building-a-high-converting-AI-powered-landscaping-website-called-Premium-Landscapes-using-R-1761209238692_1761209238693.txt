You are building a high-converting, AI-powered landscaping website called Premium Landscapes using Replit.

This project is a template and public demo, designed to be sold to future landscaping clients for £3,500 setup + £200/month retainer.

You will use HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, with integrations to Make.com, Google Sheets, Airtable, DALL·E/Midjourney, and optionally Vapi + WhatsApp.

All features must be modular, mobile-first, and white-label ready, allowing for fast rebranding (logo, colors, contact info) and client deployment.
