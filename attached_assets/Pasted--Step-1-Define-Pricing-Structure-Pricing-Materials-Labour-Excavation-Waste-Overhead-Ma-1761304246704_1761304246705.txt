🧱 Step 1: Define Pricing Structure

Pricing = Materials + Labour + Excavation + Waste + Overhead/Markup

Category	Description	How to Gather / Store Data
Material Costs	Price per m² (porcelain paving, decking, turf, fencing, etc.)	From your supplier sheet (Google Sheet → n8n read node)
Labour Costs	Cost per m² or per hour (installation, joinery, electrical, etc.)	Based on crew daily rates or averages per trade
Excavation / Base Prep	Cost per m³ of soil removed + hardcore, MOT, sand base	Add to every new hard surface area
Waste & Skip	Price per skip or tonne (based on local disposal rates)	Use postcode-based modifier
Overhead + Margin	Admin, transport, project management, profit	Fixed % markup (e.g. 25-30 %)
⚙️ Step 2: n8n Pricing Logic (Data Flow)

Webhook Node (Form Input)
User submits:

Area size(s)

Material types

Features (decking / lighting / turf / fence)

Postcode

OpenAI Node (Optional)
Parse free-text like

“Porcelain patio 55 sqm, artificial turf 25 sqm, fencing 25 m”
into structured JSON fields.

Google Sheet Lookup Node
Retrieve cost data for each feature:

Material | Unit | MatCost | LabourCost | Excavation | Waste | RegionFactor
Porcelain Paving | m² | 65 | 45 | 12 | 8 | 1.05
Artificial Turf | m² | 30 | 20 | 6 | 4 | 1.00
Composite Decking | m² | 80 | 55 | 12 | 6 | 1.10
Fence Panel | metre | 20 | 15 | 0 | 2 | 1.00


Function Node (Calculation)
Multiply each item’s area/length by cost components and region factor.
Sum totals → add overhead %.
Example formula:

total = (MatCost + LabourCost + Excavation + Waste) * Area * RegionFactor
final = total * 1.25  // 25% markup

📊 Step 3: Pricing Example (Average 2025 UK Rates)
Feature	Area/Length	All-in Rate (mat + lab + base)	Subtotal
Porcelain Patio	55 m²	£120/m²	£6,600
Artificial Turf	25 m²	£70/m²	£1,750
Fencing (Timber Panels)	25 m	£70/m	£1,750
Composite Decking	15 m²	£135/m²	£2,025
Lighting & Electrics	8 uplights	£80 each	£640
Excavation & Waste	3 skips + base prep	£600/skip avg	£1,800

Estimated Total: £14,500 – £16,000 (all-in, inc. labour + materials + waste + markup)

🧠 Step 4: Smart Enhancements

AI Area Estimation – from photo: use GPT-4 Vision node to infer rough m², reducing user input friction.

Regional Pricing Adjustment – add 5-10 % premium for South East/London postcodes.

Material Swap Simulation – offer alternatives instantly (“Porcelain → Sandstone saves £900”).

Confidence Meter – rate quote accuracy (e.g., “92 % accurate based on 64 similar jobs”).

🧰 Step 5: Implementation Options

If you upload your pricing document (labour + materials + base rates), I can:

Convert it into a Google Sheet schema ready for n8n lookups, and

Build the n8n workflow JSON including all logic (input → parse → calculate → PDF → email).

Alternatively, if you want me to price this exact before/after project using verified 2025 UK average landscaping rates, I can calculate a full detailed estimate table for it right now.
